  <p> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
    classical
    Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
    professor at
    Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
    from a Lorem
    Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
    undoubtable
    source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
    (The Extremes
    of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
    very popular
    during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes
    from a line in
    section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for
    those interested. Sections
    1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
    exact
    original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. </p>
